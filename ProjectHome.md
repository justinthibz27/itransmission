iTransmission is a native BitTorrent client on iOS, uses libtransmission as its backend.

## UPDATE ##
NEW: I'm sorry that I haven't been updating it for a long time. It turns out school burdened me a lot more than I expected. I cannot promise any further commitment on this project. If anyone would like to maintain a newer version, he or she should do so by forking iTransmission from github.com/ccp0101/iTransmission. The old version has several flaws that do NOT exist in new version. Make sure you fork the right one. :(

Users experiencing issues should go to issues tab and check out other people's solutions. In particular, backgrounding does not work in anyway without help of other tools. It's none of iTransmission's issue really. However, users looking for workarounds may install backgrounder in Cydia.

OLD: A rewritten version is on its way. It's identified by build number and can be found in Downloads tab. It **DOES NOT have most features** yet!! Should only work on iOS 4.3 and above (including iOS 5). It supports only armv7 CPUs, so iPhone 3G and older devices are no longer supported!

## For version 0.x and 1.x ##

**Minimum iOS 4.0 for iPhone and iOS 3.2 for iPad is required**. Older iPhones or iPod Touches may suffer severely in performance.

**Works best with Safari Download Plugin and Backgrounder installed.**

Please download the newest IPA file from Downloads tab. **For those who previously installed from my Cydia repository please uninstall it from Cydia and then install newer version (that I'll keep updating) from Downloads tab.**

Currently it supports following features:
  * Adding task from torrent URL, magnet or local filesystem.
  * Transmissionâ€™s web interface.
  * Automatic port mapping (UPnP) for users behind routers.
  * Choosing which network interface (Cellular network or WiFi) to use.
  * Connection and speed limits
  * Pretty UI
