## Feature Requests ##
These are features I (or other users) would like to see added to iTransmission:

  1. **Swipe To Delete**: In the overview screen, the ability to swipe to the left on a torrent and have it bring up a red "Delete" button on the right-hand side, as opposed to having to click EDIT, then mark the torrent, then click the trashcan icon.
    * Perhaps have a toggle switch in the settings that would enable or disable this feature.
  1. **Magnet Link Clipboard Watching**: Have iTransmission watch the iOS clipboard for a magnet:? link, and if one is found, prompt the user automatically to add it as an active torrent.
    * This could be in addition to the manual method of adding a magnet link, and would greatly simply using such links.
    * iTransmission should clear the clipboard if the user adds the magnet link, so that the application wouldn't try to add multiple magnet links for the same torrent.
  1. **Custom "Save To" Destination Folder**: Have an option in iTransmission to either save to the default location, or save to a custom folder.
    * Since iOS must be jailbroken in order to run iTransmission, it can write to destinations outside the sandbox.
    * iOS video playback applications such as [OPlayer](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oplayer/id344784375?mt=8) (paid, or [OPlayer Lite](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oplayer-lite/id385907472?mt=8), which is the free version), or the equivalent iPad apps, read video files from their own Documents folder (for OPlayer, this is the Documents folder under OPlayer.app), thus to view video files, the user must first download them using iTransmission, then use an external application such as [iFile](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/eu.heinelt.ifile) on the iOS or [i-FunBox](http://www.i-funbox.com/) on the computer to manually move the files from the iTransmission download folder to the video app's playback folder.
  1. **Individual File Download**: Users have requested the ability to select individual files inside a multi-file torrent.
